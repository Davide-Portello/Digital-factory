The project objective was related to the development of an automated phyton code to model the dynamics of a production line in a virtual environment. Specifically, the algorithm took as input data from a manufacturing simulator and, as an output, returned the coordinates of line assets frame by frame, resulting in a visible application of simulation data according to the Digital Twin framework.
